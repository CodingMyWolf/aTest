Assembler Test file alone in a single repo because im a psychopath

How to use this tester - 

You can just copy paste it into an ide, or if you are using a ssh to silo or another 
command line interface do the following.

1 - Navigate to your project folder, or where you want the tester to be.

2 - type 'git init'   -This will initialize the folder to work with github.

3 - type 'git clone https://github.com/CodingMyWolf/aTest.git' - this will put
    the files in your folder.

4 - Use the file as indicated by the instructions at the beiginning. 

5 - to run your program, type 'python3 <program> >> test.txt'
  
    the >> is piping the output of the command into a file.
    you do this because the output is very long, and its difficult to
    just read in the command line, so we put it into a file called test.txt
    so we can read it more efficiently and easily in vim.
    
6 - type 'vim test.txt' to view the results of the test. 
    Depending on which tests you used, the output will be different,
    but comprehensive. It should be simple enough to understand, but
    if you have any trouble, feel free to email me @ mvidali@iu.edu
    
Good Luck All!
